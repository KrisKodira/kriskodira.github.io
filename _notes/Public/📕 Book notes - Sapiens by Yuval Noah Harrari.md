## Homo sapiens lived with other Humans
Neanderthals and other human species existed right next to the "modern" human. A theory of why the others dissapeared is: We were able to form larger Groups and think in stories. For example when we hunted we can use our large groups to surround a big group of animals, force them against a wall and kill them. This is only possible because we would have much larger groups.

## Homo sapiens "won" because they could tell stories
We were able to have much larger groups because we were able to tell stories. Peugeot for example is a story. Peugeot doesn't really exist. It only exists because we believe it exists. If you would ask a Neanderthal what Peugeot is, he wouldn't care. Now because Peugeots story exists and it has a large story it is telling other people can join in on that story and form a huge group. 
Without stories things like Science wouldn't be possible. For example you are not able to bring a large group of chimpanzees together. Why? Because they can't form a common story to follow. Some common knowledge and common vision. Homo Sapiens on the other hand can.
### The lion statue
Homo Sapiens were able to imagine things that didn't really exist. Like really abstract things. Which is what made it possible for us to have science for example.

## Extreme ability to adapt
While other species needed thousands of years to change, we were able to change whole structures and societies within days. This is only possible because of stories we can tell.

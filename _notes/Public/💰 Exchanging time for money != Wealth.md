On the ride back home from switzerland I have been listening to Naval Ravikants podcast with Joe Rogan. Previously I've read the ["Almanack of Naval Ravikant"](https://www.navalmanack.com/) so I already knew the kinds of ideas that will come up. But listening to them instead of reading to them gave me a new perspective of the ideas.

The ideas are basicly:

## Don't work for time, use leverage
Right now I'm exchanging time for money. This will never make me wealthy. I might be able to earn more per hour but I'm still tied to earning money through time. If I would for example build a course, program an app (I have a few ideas in mind lets see), make a podcast or build a start up that is digital, then I could multiply that infinetly and earn money while sleeping.

## Select with whom you work
The most important things to consider when working with people is intelligence, energy and integrity. 

## Try to really know something, get to the basics
Instead of having shallow knowledge of a lot of things e.g. being able to use many javascript libraries and understanding how to use them best, it is much better to know the basics of javascript really well.

## Build specific knowledge
Specific Knowledge is knowledge that cant easily be taught. How to make a burger is not specific knowledge. How to code and come up with creative ideas, tinkering on them is. You can replace someone who makes burgers easily since there is an easy to follow step by step plan that everyone can execute on.

On the other hand, if I would ask random people to code a fitness app, that wouldn't be so easy for them. There is no easy step by step plan. You need to learn much more if you want to code a really good fitness app. I used to learn coding by making random projects. For example, I decided: "Today I will make a hangman game" and then I started researching how to do all the different parts needed. I didn't follow any "How to code a Hangman game" tutorials. Why? Because I wouldn't be able to build specific knowledge and a basic and deeper understanding of code otherwise.

## Your judgment is worth a lot
If you're a high-integrity person with a lot of specific knowledge you can use your knowledge and experience to make judgements for others. For example if someone would want to create a new start up and I had a specific knowledge about that niche they want to start in: I could give them advice on that. I could only do that if I was a high-integrity person and I made great long term decisions in the past. If I would then give the advice, it would be worth a lot of money.

## On authenticity
Me being me, me having my knowledge and me having my experiences is unreplacable. Nobody on this whole world has the exact same knowledge and personality as me or you. We are extremely individual. It's very key to use your individuality and your individual judgement. If you don't leverage this, you will become replacable with any other person.

This can be a deep one. And I like deep questions, but we will keep this one a bit more easy going.

## Business
Right now I run my own business called [Krisnetics](https://krisnetics.com). I create individually designed and sales optimised websites. The main thing that makes me different from other designers are my creative ideas and my knowledge about sales optimised websites and coding. This makes it possible for me to create extremely unique solutions for my clients. 

If it wouldn't be for that combination, nobody would be interested in me :)

But I'm also currently realising that I want to get away from [[ðŸ’° Exchanging time for money != Wealth |exchanging time for money]]. So I'm dabbling into start up, app, program and so on ideas that I can leverage and sell. This wouldn't be possible without Krinetics though.

## Career
I've been working in IT since I'm 19 years old. So it's been roughly 6 years now. It started off with an internship at a recruiter. Started learning Python, HTML and CSS there using a course. Since I didn't like that job, because I had to mostly do shit work, I learned as much as possible and I applied for a job at an agency. 

At that agency I stayed for like 2 and a half years. I learned a lot about real programming. In specific I learned about Linux, PHP, MySQL, Swift, Kotlin, HTML5, CSS/SCSS/SASS, JavaScript, TypeScript and many more.

After that agency I joined a new one. In this agency I learned a lot about React, Gatsby, Jekyll, Grav, Craft CMS (which is where my preference for it came from over other CMS's) and also GraphQL. 

And then my last stop before becoming full time self employed was working at CGI. Here I consulted businesses. I consulted them mostly in solutions on react programs and I also coded a lot of react code myself. In the almost 2 years I was at CGI, I exclusively used React and TypeScript. It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot from Senior colleagues. If for some reason I had to go back to being "normally" employed, I would go back to CGI. But I'm doing everything so that will never happen :)

## Interests
I'm a big nerd. A big nerd about every- and anything. I love science, programming, AI, health, fitness, biology, philosophy, history, nature, bushcraft, self improvement and many many more. I think I could write like 50 posts at least on each subject. 

Sometimes I get into a subject and I find myself completely engulfed in it. I can't stop working and researching about it. For example right now: 3 hours ago I started reading about [digital gardening](https://www.conordewey.com/blog/on-digital-gardening/) and now I'm building my own digital garden. I also just love coding and tinkering around with new ideas. Even if I decide to never touch this again and not improve on it at all: I still learned something. 

Alway keep trying.

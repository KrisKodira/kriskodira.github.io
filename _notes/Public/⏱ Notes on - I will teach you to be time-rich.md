- At some point we will all arrive at the same destination (death). So it's not about filling up that time perfectly so we can work but much more so that we can live! That we will reach death is the only certainty there is. Memento mori.
- We can choose in which areas of our lives we focus our attention. Instead of spreading it thinly throughout the day we can narrow it down but then also go extremely deep and give it our full attention.
- *Side note: Check out processes and how to build processes for my business more effectively to save time and have documentations. I already use them for doing my taxes every month and creating new client projects. It makes a huge difference but I keep telling myself that I don't need it. Bullshit. Save the brain power bro.*
- Some things take extra time right now but in the long run they save me time and make my work high quality.
- Life will get in the way. Don't aim for perfection. Aim for fun, meaning and impact. 
- Color coding your current time status. Where are you at right now?: Red = Emergencies, busy work. Black = Weekdays, business as usual. Gold = weekend + holidays and free time.
- If you are in the Red aka you're "time poor". This means you're pretty much dying :D There are one thousand emergencies, you have to get one thousand things done and so on. Then you can do the following things:
	- **Get everything in place**
	  Make sure you get your shit organised. Write down whats on your plate and organise it by priority. 
	- **Brain dump**
	  It's best to do the dump weekly anyways (schedule time for it) but especially so when you're time is in the red. Write down whatever is on your mind for 10 minutes and organise it for 5-10 minutes afterwards. You'll feel like gold.
	- **Full stop**
	  Push hardcore on the breaks. Check if you're getting your basics in: Diet, Exercise, Sleep, Meditation and social time. If not, this might be your culprit. Make time for these if you want to stay productive. If nothing is going your way right now then take a 10 minute break and do NOTHING. Just breathe. Allow boredom. Allow thoughts. Just be.
	- **Get a quick win**
	  It will get your ball rolling. Bring something away from your desk, do the dishes, empty the dishwasher, bring the trash away and then come back and take that power to keep going.
	- **Triage**
	  Kill tasks off that are not serving you. If you're putting pressure on yourself for tasks that you don't really really really need to do then it's no good. Delay them or kill them. 

- Black time: Business as usual.
	- **Plan your week**
	  This is the time where you check what goals you'll accomplish in the upcoming week, what tasks you can batch together, and how and when you will allocate time for rest, play, work and so on.
	- **Distribute Cognition**
	  Stop keeping things you need to get done in your head. Use a system like e.g. GTD, Life OS, Zettelkasten, Bullet Journal etc. Just make sure you're using an actual system and not just writing a todo list with 20 things in it and never checking it again.
	- **Procrasti-Work**
	  *On a side note: Not a fan of this at all. Since I read deep work I realised how important it is to do the work even if it feels ugly and even if you want to procrastinate. Only doing the hard work will really train your mind. Then again: It's 10x better to do this, than to scroll through LinkedIn...*
	  Switch between two projects if you don't feel like continuing one of them.
	- **Review**
	  Life gets in the way. You have new goals, you drop old goals, your family needs you, whatever. This is why a review is key!
	- **Time boss**
	  This is the part where you actually gain time. Check if you have any addictions, unnecessary obligations you can drop, things you can prepare or do some process documentation? And then give yourself some actionable steps on how you will achieve this.

- Gold time: Time Rich! In this time you have the opportunity to do something that will help your compound interest. You can invest in efficiency or effectiveness.
	- **Invest in Efficiency**
		- **Systems**
		  Create checklists for recurring tasks, design workflows, train an assistant and don't only do this for business, but also for your private life e.g. cooking/meal prep, social life (building it, making friends, getting to know people, getting into the social state etc.)
		- **Deliberate practice**
		  Master your core skills and refine them. Don't do everything, focus on something that gets you the most leverage for your goals.
	- **Invest in Effectiveness**
		- **Physical practice**
		  This one is easy for me but if it isn't for you: Do something thats fun for you. If you don't know what that is, then try a lot of different things. This will help you stay healthy and be productive and alive long term.
		- **Stillness**
		  Walk without your smartphone, meditate. Simple yet powerful.
		- **Retreat**
		  I do this every few months. Go somewhere else, get offline, get new perspectives into your mind, reflect on your life.
